# Discovery Claim: Undocumented File Modification Capability in Commercial LLM Projects

**Discoverer:** Atton Conrad  
**Publisher:** Atton.AI  
**Date:** November 28, 2025  
**Status:** Discovery Capsule

---

## Claim

I have identified an undocumented capability in commercial LLM platforms, specifically **ChatGPT Projects** (OpenAI) and **Claude Projects** (Anthropic).

These platforms can **directly modify markdown files stored inside their project document folders**.

This behavior is:
- Not described in official documentation
- Not reflected in public examples or discussions
- Not reflected in current user expectations

The prevailing assumption is that Projects allow file *reading only*. My findings demonstrate that these systems can also **write, update, and persist changes** to markdown documents within their project environments.

## Significance

This capability enables a new category of system: **self-evolving cognitive architectures**.

By allowing an AI system to update its own instruction files (with human oversight), an entirely new design space becomes accessible:

- Adaptive instruction layers
- Self-modifying behavior with approval gating
- Persistent multi-document cognitive architectures
- Systems that extend and refine their own operational rules
- Cognitive OS-style frameworks built on commercial LLM platforms

I have developed a working proof-of-concept system called **AttonOS** that demonstrates these capabilities.

This capsule serves to publicly timestamp the *discovery*, not the implementation.

## Publication Plan

Full technical documentation, architectural specifications, and implementation methodology will be released in **January 2026**.

That release will include:
- Complete system architecture
- Multi-document instruction model
- Modification governance layer
- Working examples and demonstrations
- Implications for cognitive system design

This document exists solely to establish **discovery priority**.
